# mouse-pathfinding
Maybe for MicroMouse, if I have the time.

I would like to write the robot code in C++, so it can easily be used with Arduino, but simulation code will be in Python, because I like it more.
But right now, I will write it in Python because I don't know how to compile C++.

- When switching to C++, replace max_depth with a timeout
